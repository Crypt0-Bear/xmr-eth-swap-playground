Cross-chain atomic swap protocol between Monero and Ethereum

This repo is for research in creating a proof of concept for cross chain trust-less Monero-Ethereum "atomic" swaps. 
*The swap is very similar to the Commit network btc-xmr atomic swaps but differs in that the hashed timelock contract is replaced with an escrow smart contract with built in auto reverse transactions. 


## How does it work?
